# Workout Tracker

This is a workout tracker app using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. With this a user will be able to enter in a workout, view their workouts for the day, and continue a workout.

## Getting Started

When the user loads the page, they come to the home page and are able to create a new workout, continue with their last workout, or also view their combined exercises. When the user clicks the "create new workout" button, a new page lets them choose from a cardio, or a resistance workout and answer questions regarding the workout. Afterwards you will be taken back to the home page to see all the workouts for the day and continue the last workout, or start a new one.

The user is able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the home page.
